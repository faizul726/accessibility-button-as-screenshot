Made for those who take screenshots often and want a more native like screenshot taking experience.

Takes advantage of Android Accessibility API to trigger system level screenshot.

Usage:
1. Go to Settings -> Accessibility
2. Find the app and enable the accessibility service
3. Select navigation bar button or floating icon depending on what you like

If it says that you can't use this setting because of security reasons then you will need to go to app info, click the 3 dot icon and click "Allow restricted settings" to remove the restriction.

Contact: None for now. Create an issue in the linked GitHub repo.
